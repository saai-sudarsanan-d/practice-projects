House of Cards is set in Washington, D.C., and is the story of Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), a Democrat from South Carolina's 5th congressional district and House Majority Whip, and his equally ambitious wife Claire Underwood (Robin Wright). Frank is passed over for appointment as Secretary of State, so he initiates an elaborate plan to attain power, aided by Claire. The series deals with themes of ruthless pragmatism,[2] manipulation, betrayal, and power.[3]

House of Cards received positive reviews and several award nominations, including 33 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor for Spacey, and Outstanding Lead Actress for Wright.[4] It is the first original online-only streaming television series to receive major Emmy nominations.[5] The show also earned eight Golden Globe Award nominations, with Wright winning for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2014 and Spacey winning for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2015.[6]

In 2017, following allegations of sexual misconduct, Netflix terminated their relationship with Spacey. The sixth (and final) season was produced and released in 2018 without his involvement.
